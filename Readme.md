# `ValidiPy`: Validated Numerics With Python #
`ValidiPy` is a suite of tools for performing *validated numerics* with Python, i.e. *rigorous* computations with finite-precision floating point arithmetic. This is achieved using *interval arithmetic*: all calculations are carried out using intervals which are guaranteed to bound the correct result at each step.

The basic file is `interval.py`.
